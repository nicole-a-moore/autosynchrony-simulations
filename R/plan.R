## start testing the feasibility of this plan 

## 1. filter to songbirds 
## 2. filter to species with enough occurrences 
## 3. plot out the data yearly over time
## 4. measure shift in range edges over time for each species

## 5. measure temporal autocorrelation across range (or studied area?)
## 6. measure spatial synchrony across range (or studied area?)

## 7. see if species whose ranges have asynchrony + autocorrelation show greater lags (slower shifts for now) at trailing edge 
## 8. see if species whose ranges have greater asynchrony + autocorrelation show less lags (faster shifts) at the leading edge 

## then regroup if this doesn't look promising 


## try measuring the thing Jenn wants:
## frequency of occupany asa function of distance from centroid 
## frequency of state change as a function of distance from centroid
